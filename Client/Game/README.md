# Game Client

This is the Game directory that should be accessible via `your-name.cs261.net/Game/`

It expects to receive the login credentials (`_token` and `_session`) in the query string, which should be provided by the login page `your-name.cs261.net/`.

You will need to update the networking logic for assignment 4, located in files [/Game/scripts/core/frame.js](https://github.com/stebee/CS261Assignment2/blob/master/Client/Game/scripts/core/frame.js) and [/Game/scripts/core/network.js](https://github.com/stebee/CS261Assignment2/blob/master/Client/Game/scripts/core/network.js)
